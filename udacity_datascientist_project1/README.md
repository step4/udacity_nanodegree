## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.\*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

1. What are the most commonly used languages for developers who use them on a daily basis?
2. How do the years of professional experience relate to the use of dynamically or statically typed programming languages?
3. Is there a difference in pay between using typed languages?

This project is a project a the DataScientist Nanodegree of Udacity

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

The additional `.csv` files are the results of the StackOverflow Survey 2019.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@c.rausch020/should-you-switch-your-daily-used-working-tool-your-programming-language-7c5b2cc0f5c9).
